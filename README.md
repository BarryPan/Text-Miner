# Text Miner - A shiny app for text mining


This repository is the the final project for STA 523 (Statistical Programming) at Duke University. 

In this project, we applied text mining, ggplot, shiny app, and machine learning clustering algorithms to build a Shiny app.

Users are allowed to upload text and obtain results including word frequency, wordcloud, relationships between words and hierarchical agglomerative clustering.
